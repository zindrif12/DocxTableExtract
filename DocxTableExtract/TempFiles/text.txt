Each Region has its own contracts and WBS structure and a Regional Manager, Commercial Manager, Quantity Surveyors, Purchasing Personnel and Administrative Support. Finance, HR, Payroll, Health and Safety, IT and MIS can be shared resource across the business or several Regions.Cape plc is requesting proposals from suitable suppliers for the provision of an integrated core business system providing the functionality to support financial management, human resource and payroll, Project and Contract Accounting, procurement, reporting and business intelligence.Current IT SystemsCape has a number of different systems in use throughout the world. These are detailed below.This RFP seeks a response for transitioning from the current ERP systems to an upgraded or new single instance ERP system which will continue to meet the business requirements and introduce some additional benefits or process improvements to the Cape Group.It is expected that the proposed solution will enable many of the current key applications to be phased out. However, where you are planning to utilise existing systems please provide details of how these will be integrated with the proposed solution.Function of ApplicationName of ApplicationApplication PurposeAsset Management (Own equipment)Jaama Asset Management SAPPerPayin Pronto Excel Asset PalSMS .NETFleet ManagementAsset ManagementEquipment managementPlant maintenanceERPSAP 4.7Sage 100Sage 300Sage 200Sage 500 Evolution Pegasus OperaMS Dynamics NAV ProntoPerPayinMaterial Advantage ExcelAccess Scafftrack ONE S (1S) COINSAccounts PayableAccounts ReceivableCredit ManagementGLApplication & CertificatesMaterials ManagementProject SystemsSales and DistributionOther Projects (ISC- Offshore Singapore, CISGL Cape plc, ETM)Payroll SystemsSAPSage Payroll EvolutionIC: Payroll PerPayin B-PlusNano Payroll ADPPegasus One S Mainland PaymasterHRMS / Interact ExcelCOINSPayroll Salary and Payroll WeeklyHR SystemsSAPPeoplebank IC: Personnel Management PerPayin Paymaster Microsoft office MainlandOne S HRISHuman ResourcePurchasingSAPSage Job Costing PerPayinSage 300 ProntoPurchase order raisingPurchase order trackingInvoice paymentOther – Time recordingLogitime T&A Plus a number of other systemsTime and Attendance systemOtherEMS Fax ServerFax documents such as Purchase Orders to suppliers.

A risk & issue register will be maintained and regularly reviewed with escalation to the SteerCo. if set tolerances are exceeded.rd.The Project Team will be a blend of Cape and 3  party ERP technical / implementation expertise, but knowledge transfer toCape will be at the heart of the plan.Sufficient scale / speed, and hence resourcing, is required to ensure the selected ERP solution and accompanying best of breed components can be deployed globally within 3 years.Change mgmt., training and acceptance testing will be prioritised as vital to the successful adoption of the new systems. Contingency planning (including roll back) will be planned in detail and rehearsed prior to each go-live.A period of post go-live support for each site will be factored into deployment plans. Application support capability will be in place in line with the deployment schedule. Deployment s will run in parallel where time constraints necessitate and resources allow.Different principles may be adopted in different regions / countries to accommodate local factors / restrictions.Deployment SequencingPhased vs. Single DeploymentSequencing to be driven by the best compromise of benefit realisation and risk management.1092708-133693The concept of a pilot site will be adopted, to prove new technology / processes and gain buy in. The pilot site will be as representative of the wider business as possible, and ideally English speaking.In MENA, Asia and CIS, the aim will be to go live in an initial country, followed by a single deployment to the remaining countries. This will be flexed as required for each region.The sequence and timing of organisational changes associated with the new GSA will be considered and determined prior to the first go-live.The deployment sequence will be agreed and base lined in Phase 2, but will be reviewed during phase 3 and may change if benefit and risk factors change. Authority to change the sequence will sit with the SteerCo.109270887842Functionality tobe deployedFunctionality tobe deployedThe initial functionality to be deployed to each site will be a balance of benefit realisation including speed of deployment, and riskfactors.1092708358173It is possible not all sites will receive the full functionality – the decision will be based on need / benefit, capability and resourcing at the site, and cost.A range of factors will be assessed in determining the optimum deployment approach.Logical groupings of functionality have been identified in Phase 1 and will be confirmed / base lined in Phase 2.A critical mass of functionality must be deployed in an initial drop, to achieve maximum business benefits with acceptable riskDeployment Considerations583256302247Preamble and Instructions for ProposalsPurpose of this RFPThe purpose of this RFP is to invite potential solution vendors to describe their capabilities and the suitability of their proposed solution for Cape’s requirements, and to make a formal quotation.
